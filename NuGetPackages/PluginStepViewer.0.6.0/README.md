Plugins for the XrmToolBox

## Plugin Steps Viewer
When working in environments consisting of many solutions with many plugins, itâ€™s often difficult to get a fair understanding about registered plugin assemblies, types and steps. You can display this information in the Plugin Registration Viewer, but the tool is slow, and you cannot filter on any criteria. As I had a need to do exactly this, I created a standalone tool to display the registered plugin steps in a flat list with some filtering options. I then decided to turn it into a plugin for the XrmToolBox. This first release v0.6.0 does not include everything you might expect. But it does give you a very fast overview about the registered steps in your environment.
